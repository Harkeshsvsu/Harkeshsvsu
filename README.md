**Technologies Used**
Solidity: Smart contract development.
Remix IDE: Used for writing and testing the smart contract.
Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM): The contract is designed to run on an EVM-compatible blockchain, such as Neo.
MetaMask: For interacting with the smart contract (optional if frontend is added later).
Web3.js or Ethers.js: (Optional for future frontend integration).
Smart Contract Overview
The smart contract tracks the following:

Fertilizer Release: The government releases fertilizers to registered retailers.
Retailer Confirmation: Retailers confirm that theyâ€™ve received the fertilizers.
Farmer Monitoring: Farmers can view the available stock of fertilizers at their nearest retailers.
The contract ensures that only authorized participants (government and retailers) can interact with specific functions while providing transparency to farmers.

Features
Government-Managed Fertilizer Distribution:

The government releases fertilizers to specific retailers, and the transaction is recorded on the blockchain.
Retailer Confirmation:

Retailers confirm the receipt of fertilizers by calling a function on the smart contract, ensuring they have the stock they claim.
Real-Time Fertilizer Stock Monitoring:

Farmers can monitor the available fertilizer stock for their nearest retailer through the contract.
Immutable Records:

All records are stored on the blockchain, making the data tamper-proof and transparent for all parties involved.
How to Deploy and Test the Contract
Step 1: Open Remix IDE
Visit Remix IDE.
Create a new file called FertilizerTracking.sol and paste the code from the contract.
Step 2: Compile the Contract
Make sure the compiler version in Remix is set to 0.8.0 or higher.
Click the "Compile" button to compile the contract.
Step 3: Deploy the Contract
Go to the Deploy & Run Transactions tab.
Select Injected Web3 or JavaScript VM depending on whether you're using a local blockchain or test network.
Deploy the contract by clicking Deploy.
Step 4: Interact with the Contract
Once deployed, you can interact with the functions of the contract:
Use releaseFertilizer to simulate the government releasing a fertilizer batch to a retailer.
Use confirmReceipt to simulate the retailer confirming they have received the batch.
Use viewFertilizerStock to check the current stock of fertilizers at a retailer.
Use getBatchDetails to retrieve the details of a specific fertilizer batch.
Future Work
Frontend Integration: Integrating the smart contract with a web interface to provide a user-friendly experience for farmers.
IoT Integration: Adding IoT devices for tracking real-time movement of fertilizer bags.
Multi-Signature Transactions: Ensuring multiple approvals before finalizing certain transactions for added security.
